Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower.

Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear.

JAP_mechanized_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Type 1 Ho-Ha was developed in 1941 as a result of a request from the army for a vehicle that could be used to transport a squad of infantry to the battlefield protected from enemy small arms fire. Despite experiences of the Second Sino-Japanese War, armored personnel carriers were viewed as too slow compared to wheeled trucks and there was not much effort for their development in the army. It could carry 13 passengers and had a max of 8mm armor."

Available in both single and dual mounts the gun fired either high explosive or incendiary shrapnel shells that weighed 20.6 kilograms, with a complete round weighing 32.4 kilograms. About 3000 were built from 1921 to 1945."

The Type 99 was designed similarly to the Type 38, but fired a 7.7mm cartridge instead of a 6.5x50mm. It was a solid bolt-action rifle, but was outclassed at close range by automatic weapons. While it was intended to completely replace the Type 38, this never materialized due to resource and production constraints. About 3,500,000 were built from 1939 to 1945."

The barrel was slightly longer, and the bayonet mounting bar / bipod were eliminated. Due to the late stage of the war, corners were cut frequently in production, but the weapon still had great field performance. About 8,000 were built from 1944 to 1945."

Rather than designing one from scratch, they elected to copy the M1 Garand, which they were coming into frequent contact with on the Pacfic Theater. The Type 4 was a reversed engineered copy of the M1 Garand, which had an internal magazine as opposed to an en-bloc clip. The rifle was supposed to begin mass production in 1945, but only 100 of a 250-gun order were completed before the war ended."

The mortar had a 3 kilometer range and a 170 kg projectile. The gun was extremely heavy and could not be elevated more than 50 degrees due to balance of the vehicle. The design was well-received but it would have been expensive to produce, and so attention instead went to self-propelled multiple rocket launchers instead. 4 units were built in 1944, but none were used in combat."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_short:0 "Lanchester 6x4"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed during the 1920s by the Lanchester Motor Company, the 6x4 had good cross country performance and was easy to maintain. It featured a fully traversing, two-man turret, but the 90 hp engine struggled with the vehicle's weight. First deployed in 1929, it served into the 1930s before being phased out."
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2:0 "Morris CS9 Armoured Car"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2_short:0 "Morris CS9"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_2_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Morris Commercial C9 truck, the CS9 replaced a number of WWI-era designs. The open-top turret usually mounted a 13.7 mm Boys anti-tank rifle, and a 7.62 mm Bren light machine gun. The 94 hp engine gave the vehicle good performance on soft ground - when fitted with the correct tires."
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3:0 "Daimler Mk II Armoured Car"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3_short:0 "Daimler Mk II"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_3_desc:0 "A heavier development of the successful Daimler Dingo scout car. Produced in large quantities, their welded, sloped hulls were relatively well armoured, while the 4.1 litre 95 hp engine gave decent performance. The armoured car was equipped with a 2 pdr 40mm gun, and a coaxial 7.92 Besa machine gun."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_4_short:0 "Humber Mk IV"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_4_desc:0 "Made by the Rootes Group by combining the Indian Army's Karrier KT4 artillery tractor, with the Guy armoured car. The definitive production Mk IV version mounted a US-made 37 mm gun, and a 7.92 mm coaxial Besa machine gun. The vehicle had a long career and surplus Humbers were sold to nations all over the world."

NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_short:0 "AEC Mk II"
NZL_armored_cars_equipment_5_desc:0 "Built by the Associated Equipment Company on the chassis of their Matador 4x4 artillery tractor. The 158 hp diesel engine enabled the vehicle to mount a 6 pdr 57 mm gun, and coaxial 7.92 mm Besa machine gun, while still maintaining excellent mobility on long patrols. The AEC remained valuable for years to come."
